  Visiting the impressive Buddhist temples in Bangkok has been the highlight
  during this trip in Asia. I could spend days wandering around taking photos
  from various angles. Here are some of the shots from Wat Arun and Wat Pho. Two
  of the most famous temples in Bangkok, both along the river Chao Praya.
